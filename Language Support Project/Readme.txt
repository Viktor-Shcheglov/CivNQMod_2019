If you are here to help translate lekmod, then welcome!

This document explains how you should work and make everything as easy as possible.

=========================================================================================================

You will find in this folder Civ5Units_Mongol.xml. In here are all the overrides for all text related things in lekmod. 
All the current text is defined in the <language_en_us></language_en_us> Tag.
Simply put, if you, for example, want to translate Lekmod to French, you copy all of the text inside of the language_en_us tag, 
then paste it inside the <language_fr_fr></language_fr_fr> tag which you can find at the end of the document. 
Once pasted, you then can proceed translating all the text inside the <Text></Text> tags!

=========================================================================================================

Hopefully you will have the fortune to work with other translators. If so, we will tell you who, so you can dicuss with them on which parts everyone does, so everything can go as smooth as possible!

Note, this is a long process, as this mod basically changes all the text inside this game. No worries though, as there is no hard time limit on this.
Do keep updating your progression regulary, as this makes it easier to work with other translators.

If you are here but still aren't fimiliar with Github, i'd suggest looking online how to do merge/pull requests as this is the best way to work together with other translators!
